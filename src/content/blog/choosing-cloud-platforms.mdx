Which cloud platform to specialize in?

* EmperorSkogkatt on this reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureCertification/comments/10ok27f/how_does_azure_certifications_compare_with_aws_or/) said it best, “AWS is the 800 pound gorilla in the room. You can't go wrong with knowing AWS because it is so dominant in the industry.”
* You should always choose AWS or Azure over GCP
* According to Market Data, there are more jobs for AWS over Azure and GCS as of 202X.
