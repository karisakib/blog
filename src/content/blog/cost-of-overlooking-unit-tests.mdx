The cost of overlooking unit tests
- code runs in test harness as developed
- Pros and cons
- Time consuming but effective for robust development
- Using CICD for automated tests
- Write once, run every time (taken from Java)
- Saves effort and time later in the project
- Itâ€™s an overlooked skill but worth investing time into
- Saves costs later in the SDLC
- Lots of risk mitigation and defect avoidance
