ISTQB Performance Tester Syllabus Mistake - SOAP / REST

Communication protocols define a set of communications rules between computers
and systems. Designing tests properly to target specific parts of the system requires
understanding protocols.
Communication protocols are often described by the Open Systems Interconnection
(OSI) model layers (see ISO/IEC 7498-1), although some protocols may fall outside of
this model. For performance testing, protocols from Layer 5 (Session Layer) to Layer
7 (Application Layer) are most commonly used for performance testing. Common
protocols include:
 Database - ODBC, JDBC, other vendor-specific protocols
 Web - HTTP, HTTPS, HTML
 Web Service - SOAP, REST
Generally speaking, the level of the OSI layer which is most in focus in performance
testing relates to the level of the architecture being tested. When testing some low-
level, embedded architecture for example, the lower numbered layers of the OSI model
will be mostly in focus.
